Exercise2:
 5. Real-time Chat Application Programming Exercise
 Problem Statement
 Create a simple real-time chat application where users can join different chat rooms or create
 their own chat rooms. Users should be able to send and receive messages in real-time.
 Functional Requirements
 1. Allow users to create/join chat rooms by entering a unique room ID.
 2. Enable users to send and receive messages in real-time within a chat room.
 3. Display a list of active users in the chat room.
 4. Optional: Implement a private messaging feature between users.
 5. Optional: Implement message history, so the chat persists even if the user leaves and rejoins.
 Key Focus
 1. Behavioral Pattern: Use the Observer Pattern to notify clients of new messages or user
 activities.
 2. Creational Pattern: Use Singleton to manage the state of the chat rooms.
3. Structural Pattern: Use the Adapter Pattern to allow the system to work with different types of
 client communication protocols (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.).
 4. OOP: Apply encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance effectively.
 Possible Inputs
 Chat Room ID: "Room123"
 Messages: "Hello, everyone!", "How's it going?", "Goodbye!"
 Active Users: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
 Possible Outputs
 Chat Messages: Display a list of messages in the format 
[username]: [message]
 Active Users: Display a list of usernames of the active users in the chat room.
 Evaluation
 1. Code Quality: Does the code adhere to best practices, SOLID principles, and design
 patterns?
 2. Functionality: Does the application satisfy all the functional requirements, and does it handle
 real-time data effectively?
 3. Global Convention: Is the code structured and written in a globally understandable manner?
 4. Gold Standards: Are there gold standards in logging, error handling, and other robust
 features?
 5. Code Walkthrough: Will the candidate be able to articulate the decisions taken during coding,
 design patterns used, and the overall architecture?
 Intent of this exercise is to cover a balance blend of complexity and practicality, allowing
 candidates to display both their coding finesse and architectural understanding...
